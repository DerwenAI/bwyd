# Bwyd cooking DSL

> "Everything said is said by an observer." â€“ Maturana and Varela, _Autopoiesis_


## Abstract

Goal: _Implement a DSL to simplify means for defining good recipes rapidly,
while using computational tools to catch errors and inconsistencies, scale
portions, calculate yields, and so on._

The seed crazy idea behind the scenes here is to consider how human cooks
behave somewhat like robots, following recipes as instructions.
Recipes make cooks "programmable" to some extent.

Conversely, what if detailed cooking instructions could be expressed in a way
that was computable and represented independently of specific human languages?
In other words, representing the processes of cooking as source code plus
semi-structured data?

This project is an application of contemporary software engineering to how
people in professional kitchens think about their work.

Code in **Bwyd** language represents the "structure" and "art" of cooking,
which can then be parameterized and rendered as text to generate recipes
for a broader audience of home cooks.

A secondary use for **Bwyd** as a DSL is to provide an intermediate for
leveraging _Generative AI_ to manipulate recipes with the quality required
by use in professional kitchens.


## Language Constructs

### `Ratio`

These represent dimensionless structures, as the ratios (by weight) of key
components in cooking.

A close programming analogy would be _abstract classes_.
Per author Michael Ruhlman, `Ratios` represent
"the _truth_ of cooking, all that is unchanging, fixed, elemental.

Structure defines the "craft" of cooking.
In practice, `Ratio` objects allow for scaling recipes.

### `Closure`

These define process, based on `Ratios`, for how to use ingredients,
equipment, and techniques to make specific products.

A close programming analogy would be _generators_, and internally
these behave similar to Petri nets with pre- and post- conditions.
Recalling "Old School" AI from the 1980s, these function much like
unpopulated frames.

Codifying the practice, `Closure` objects describe steps in cooking,
specifying parameterizations (scale, ingredient substitutions) and
describing yields produced, while consuming recursively from other
`Closure` definitions within a personalized library.

```
  CLOSURE: "cookie dough"

    // commands...

  YIELD (100 g)
```

Process defines the "art" of cooking.
In practice, `Closure` objects allow for team collaboration and
planning within a professional kitchen work environment.

### `Observable`

These represent the experienced end-consumer of a graph of
parameterized `Closure` objects, for a particular event.

A close programming analogy would be _logs_ for one CI pipeline
instance, where ops data gets collected and feedback may be
used to guide subsequent modifications of the `Closure`
definitions which were invoked.

Experience defines the shared  "communication" of cooking.
In practice, `Observable` objects collect audience annotations
(photos, comments, stories, successs/failures) for recipes.
