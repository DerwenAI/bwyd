## Verbs

Could link the _verb_ references in `Action` objects to tutorials via the internal KG?

`mix`, `fold`, `cut`, `spread`, `whisk`, `beat`, `roll`


Other language constructs to be added are `Substitutions` and `Pairings`,
per Niki Segnit, [_The Flavor Thesaurus_](https://www.nikisegnit.com/the-flavour-thesaurus)
and the concepts of _lateral cooking_ which she's explored.


## Research

  * <https://huggingface.co/collections/pacoid/bwyd-66fa446360ff0bbc5deddd59>


## Ideation

Each recipe is a _causal graph_, with the yields of each step as
intermediate outcomes.

Underlying graph produces:

  * format recipe for publication
  * scale based on desired yield
  * determine a causal graph to test substitutions as interventions
  * track results of instance (collecting data for CSM, see above)
  * plan with required equipment, ingredients, and timing

Could possibly use the recent code-completion API in Jupyter notebooks, working with a Bwyd kernel?

A saved notebook could encapsulate an `Observable` session?
  - use ipywidgets for search, scaling, equipment list, etc., ?

## Taxonomy

At the core, the configuration of the **Bwyd** language is based on a _knowledge graph_.

  - ratio
  - ingredient
  - technique
  - tool

within Closure implies "ADD TO FOCUS MENTIONED MOST RECENTLY"

within Closure implies "USE TOOL MENTIONED MOST RECENTLY"

Then a LLM renders the text for a parameterized recipe.

## Example

### 1. CLOSURE: prepare dough

NOTE: best to work with cold ingredients and chilled utensils

RATIO: dough

FOCUS (CONTAINER: chilled mixing bowl)

ADD (INGREDIENT: 1 large chicken egg)

ACTION: using (TOOL: small whisk or a fork)
	(UNTIL: egg is beaten lightly)
	(TIME: 30 sec)

ADD (INGREDIENT: 250 ml whole milk ricotta), (INGREDIENT: 50 g grated parmesan), (INGREDIENT: 1 g freshly grated nutmeg)

STIR using (TOOL: spatula)
	(UNTIL: well mixed)
	(TIME: 30 sec)

ADD (INGREDIENT: 1 cup reduced veggie pur√©e)

FOLD
	(UNTIL: lightly mixed)
	(TIME: 30 sec)

ADD (INGREDIENT: 240 g flour - rice, oat, etc.)
    (UNTIL: dough is no longer sticky)
    (TIME: 60 sec))

MIX
	(UNTIL: dough just becomes smooth)
	(TIME: 30 sec)


### 2. CLOSURE: cut dumplings

NOTE: divide dough into 8 pieces, rolling out one at a time

FOCUS (CONTAINER: rolling surface)

SPREAD (INGREDIENT: 10 g flour - rice, semolina)
	(TIME: 30 sec)

ADD (DEPEND: .125 dough)

ROLL by hand
	carefully
	(RESULT: 2 cm diameter "rope")
	(TIME: 60 sec)

CUT using (TOOL: fork)
	(RESULT: 1 cm dumplings pieces, which resemble little pillows)
	(TIME: 30 sec)


### 3. CLOSURE frozen dumplings

NOTE: add layers of dumplings to fill depth of baking dish

FOCUS (CONTAINER: baking dish)

LINE with (INGREDIENT: cut parchment paper)
	(TIME: 30 sec)

ROLL (DEPEND: cut dumplings) using (TOOL: fork or gnocchi grater)
ARRANGE on parchment paper, without touching other dumplings
	(TIME: 10 sec)

FREEZE
	(RESULT: solid dumplings)
	(TIME: 2 hrs)


### 4. STORE gnocchi

FOCUS (CONTAINER: freezer bag)

TRANSFER (DEPEND: frozen dumplings) from parchment paper
	(TIME: 5 min)

(STORE: in freezer until ready to cook)

(YIELDS: 6 servings)
